# Snake-Game-Challenge

> The Snake Game project is a technical assessment tool designed to test the software development skills of potential candidates. The game is a classic game of survival where the player controls a snake that must eat food to grow and avoid obstacles in order to survive.
The game also includes a scoring system that tracks the player’s progress and keeps track of their high scores. This helps the candidate showcase their progress and allows for easy comparison between different players.
